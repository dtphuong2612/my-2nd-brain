At first I thought I might not be able to finish reading this book. There are two reasons for me to say that, the first is that it\'s too long and the second is that I\'ve always thought Greek mythology would be boring to read. But to my surprise, I read it all without skipping a single page.\\nThe story focuses on the love between two princes, Achilles and Patroclus, leaving me completely mesmerized by its beauty. They exhibited bravery and reciprocal kindness. Especially, their love is so strong that they never lie to one another.\\nTheir story moved me to tears, and I will add it to my list of books that I absolutely love. ***The Song of Achilles*** is a great piece of work.\\n\\n![\'Achilles\'](./img/achilles.jpg)"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/07-03-2023/index.md","source":"@site/blog/07-03-2023/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Hi guys \ud83d\udc4b","date":"2023-07-28T07:38:34.000Z","formattedDate":"July 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"facebook","permalink":"/blog/tags/facebook"},{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"github","permalink":"/blog/tags/github"}],"readingTime":0.52,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Phuong Duong","title":"Machine Learning Engineer","url":"https://github.com/dtphuong2612","imageURL":"img/453fcbdc53c78999d0d6.jpg","key":"dttph"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["dttph"],"tags":["facebook","hello","github"],"sidebar_position":1},"prevItem":{"title":"The Song of Achilles_Madeline Miller","permalink":"/blog/The Song of Achilles_Madeline Miller"}},"content":"**Hi guys \ud83d\udc4b**\\n\\nI\'m Phuong Duong who is a final year student at National Economics University.
