 Thanks for reading!!!

## About me:

My name is Phuong Duong. I majored in Data Science in Economics and Business at the National Economics University. I am currently developing as a Machine Learning Engineer.

I write this blog with two main purposes. One is to synthesize my own knowledge. Second, I hope to be able to share that knowledge with everyone.
