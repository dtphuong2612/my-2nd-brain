## I.Vector

### 1.What is a vector?

***A vector*** is a quantity or phenomenon that has two independent properties: ***magnitude*** and ***direction***. 

***Vectors*** are special objects that can be ***added together*** and ***multiplied by scalars*** to produce another object of the same kind.

### 2. Vector Representation

Only 2D and 3D can use *geometric vectors*. How many *extra dimensions* would the vector have?
