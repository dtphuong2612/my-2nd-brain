## ***chapter one: the importance of context***

### ***Exploratory vs. explanatory analysis***

Exploratory analysis is what you do to understand the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight to others. When we do exploratory analysis, it's like hunting for pearls in oysters. We might have to open 100 oysters(test 100 different hypotheses or look at the data in 100 different ways) to find perhaps two pearls. 

Explanatory analysis meaning you have a specific thing you want to explain, a specific story you want to tell-probably about those two pearls. 

So, we focus on **explanatory** analysis and communication.

### ***Who, what, and how***

*First, To whom are you communicating?* 

*Second, what do you want your audience to know or do?*

*Finnal, how can you use data to help make your point?*

**Who**

*Your Audience:*
